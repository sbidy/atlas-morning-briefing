Today's briefing highlights a surge of interest in multi-agent evaluation frameworks, with three independent papers proposing new benchmarks. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's 3.2% dip correlates with tightened export controls -- worth watching as it may affect compute availability for the large-scale training papers we track.

## Today's Key Connections

- Multi-agent evaluation is this week's dominant theme: 3 new papers + Anthropic's blog post on tool-use testing all converge on the same problem
- The NVIDIA export control news directly impacts reproduction feasibility for GPU-intensive papers (2 of today's top picks require multi-GPU setups)
- DeepMind's new blog post on chain-of-thought distillation aligns with ArXiv paper #4 on lightweight reasoning

## Top Papers for Reproduction

### 1. AgentBench v2: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multi-Agent Evaluation
**Authors**: Chen, Wang, Li

This paper introduces AgentBench v2 with 12 new evaluation tasks covering collaboration, competition, and tool-use scenarios. Key contribution: a standardized evaluation protocol that works across different agent frameworks.

**Score**: 9.45 | **Difficulty**: M

**Why this paper**: Directly addresses your core interest in agent evaluation with a comprehensive, reproducible benchmark.

**Score Breakdown**:
- Code Available: True
- Topic Match: 0.923
